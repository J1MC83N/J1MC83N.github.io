<p>Zinc is a great metal.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hefty, naturally shiny, very skin-friendly, reasonably hard, and has a melting point of 419.5˚C, below the Curie point of iron. Why is last point important? Because it means you can build a zinc-melting furnace out of any induction cooker. </p>
<p>A run-down of the science: an induction cooker heats up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a> metals like iron and nickel; it does so with a coil that, when powered with fast alternating current, creates current in said metals via electromagnetic induction which heats them up via the via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect">skin effect</a>. The catch is that ferromagnetism stops working above the Curie point, which for iron is 770˚C, and so induction cookers stop working at that point as well. Thus theoretically speaking, your induction cooker can heat your iron/steel pan all the way up to red hot, but no further. Sure, a good propane burner can almost melt the same pan with a white hot flame, but personally I find induction science cooler. </p>
<p>DSC04635.jpg</p>
<p>So the idea was this: take the cheapest induction cooker online, rewind the heating coil around an iron crucible as well as some generous amount of thermal insulation, and we got ourselves a homemade furnace that can melt zinc with all renewable energy, no open flame required. Simple idea really that turned out pretty fruitful; I&#39;m surprised no one on the internet has tried something similar. </p>
<p>18-yo me was super proud of himself for coming up with that idea and was already envisioning his glorious zinc-casting career. Because, a fun fact about me, I&#39;ve always liked metallic objects, just something about the heft and durability of them that tickled some obscure part of my brain. And now you&#39;re telling me that, instead of collecting drawers full of scrap metal parts, I could be making shiny metal objects all I want at home? Yes please. </p>
<p>Now the keen-eyed metal-philic reader may wonder, why not melt and cast aluminum? It melts at 660˚C which is also below 770˚C, and it&#39;s a much more popular choice for metal casting hobbyists and for good reasons. The short answer is that 660˚C is a bit too hot for my home-grown furnace to reach and sustain, also latent heat of fusion sucks. The smarter-sounding answer is that science doth not make a working furnace, engineering does, and I&#39;m far from an engineer &#40;no software engineering doesn&#39;t count&#41;. </p>
<p>The main engineering challenge of this &quot;induction furnace&quot; <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class="fnref">[1]</a></sup> is essentially 1&#41; crucible needs to be hot, 2&#41; coil needs to cool, and 3&#41; these two things need to be physically close to each other for the whole thing to work. Point 1 is straightforward, the crucible should be at and preferably above the melting point of whatever metal it holds. Point 2 stems from the fact that induction cooker coils are made from enameled copper wires &#40;specifically Litz wires&#41;, and the enamel layer breaks down at as little as 105˚C. Point 3 is because magnetic field generated by the coil drops off fast with distance to the whatever it is heating up. </p>
<p>To tackle these challenges, I designed my furnace as a layered bowl, hot things inside, cool things outside. From inside to outside, the layers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Iron crucible;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thermal insulation: at 419.5˚C ceramic fiber is really the only option &#40;but also a huge pain to work with&#41;;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Structure material &#40;i.e. bowl&#41;: to hold the bowl shape;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Coil wires;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thermal conductor: to suck heat away from wires and also hold/stick wires to the bowl;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Water cooling tubes;</p>
</li>
<li><p>High temperature protection for the tubes: in case I accidentally spill molten zinc &#40;yes it has happened and I&#39;ve learned my lessons&#41;. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<table class="fndef" id="fndef:1">
    <tr>
        <td class="fndef-backref"><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a></td>
        <td class="fndef-content">why the quotation marks? Because the term <em>induction furnace</em> is already taken and means something slightly different. Yes our furnace also melts metals with induction, but an actual induction furnace uses much higher-frequency AC to heat any conductive material to much higher temperatures without relying on the skin effect. Our furnace could technically be called a low-frequency induction furnace, but I think that title is undeserved.</td>
